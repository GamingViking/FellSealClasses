## Welcome, fellow lover of Fell Seal, to my Fell Seal Expansion PaC (Portraits and Classes)!

### Preamble
What I enjoy most about Fell Seal is the creative ways in which the many different abilities of different classes can be combined in fun, powerful, and unexpected ways. Having played quite a bit and tried many of these combinations, I sought to add more options to the theory crafting pool of Fell Seal's numerous abilities without power-creeping existing classes into irrelevance. As such, nearly all active abilities are completely new abilities that I have made from the soup of accessible and alterable ability properties found in game; the goal being to create classes with new niches, playstyles, and combinations, without merely creating a selection of super classes. Additionally, all passive and counter abilities are either newly created or abilities that were previously only accessible to monster/non-generic classes. In seeking to expand options of play, I have also created a number of new character portraits for all manner of characters to increase the existing selection, have portraits which more closely match in-game aesthetic options, and have portraits of lesser-used items/equipment/aesthetics to make picking those options seem viable when selecting a portrait. This is my first mod - I hope you enjoy!

### What the mod adds
* 10 (and counting) fully custom classes with new, diverse, and balanced (hopefully!) abilities  
* A new weapon type for one of the new classes featuring 7 weapons  
* Numerous new portraits based on the aesthetic options available in character creation in order to make visual matching a reality as well as more portraits of people with darker skin tones, class helmets, accessories, and gear color combinations

### Installation
**This mod uses abilities from the DLC (Missions and Monsters) and it is required for the mod to work**
* If using a mod manager, simply download and install according to your mod manager's instructions.
* If installing manually, most files will be copied into your customdata folder found at "C:\Users\username\Documents\Fell Seal\customdata", that includes all files except for the portraits and "abilities.txt", "ingredients.txt", and "weapons.txt". The latter three go in "C:\Users\username\Documents\Fell Seal\customdata\languages\en". If you have never modded Fell Seal before, you may need to create the "languages" and "en" folders.
* Portrait installation is the same for any other custom portrait you would upload, inside of "C:\Users\username\Documents\Fell Seal\customdata\portraits" there are folders for "female", "male", and "unisex" in which you should place the relevant portraits. 

### Complete Class List
* **Monster Hunter** - Mobile hunters who use specialized grappling hooks to maneuver over difficult terrain as well as displace and dispatch prey. They also employ an array of traps meant for all manner of creatures. 
* **Dancer** - Dancers flow gracefully across the battlefield, evading harm, beguiling their enemies, and captivating all who come near. 
* **Martial Artist** - These skillfull warriors unleash devastating combos by using a series setup techniques to charge their qi before delivering a finishing strike. Qi charges cap at 3. Each setup move can only be used once before a finisher is used. 
* **Demonologist** - These fanatics' lust for power is unbridled - willingly giving their blood to obtain the power and servitude of demons.
* **Geomancer** - Deeply in tune with their environemnt, these casters adapt to their surroundings as their powers wax and wane with the seasons.
* **Infected** - The tainted blood of these once proud knights is a carrier for all types of diseases which they freely employ to bring low any who would stand before them. 
* **Exorcist** - These spiritual specialists have learned how to attack the corporeal essence of maladies, literally beating away ailments and pain. Of course, that doesn't stop them from bashing their enemies on the physical plane as well.
* **Gladiator** - Once legionnaires, these battle-tested warriors know the strategies and formations of war as well as the tactics and grit of those fighting to survive in the colesseum. 
* **Time Traveler** - Having been to the distant future, these unusual combatants are gifted at affecting the flow of time and using futuristic X-weapons. 
* **Fell Arbiter** - Only a powerful marked can channel the dark energies of the Maw to become a Fell Arbiter, but while doing so grants great power, the Maw's infuence corrupts those who would channel its power - tempting them to sacrifice all that they hold dear for greater boons.
