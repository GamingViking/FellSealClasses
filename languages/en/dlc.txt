miss-90-desc=A strange gateway suddenly appeared and then vanished, but not before a strange looking person came out of it. The stranger dropped some sort of alien artefact before departing which seems to have attracted some unusual creatures to the area, so it might be best to send someone knowledgeable in the {color=hint}mystical{color=base} arts.
miss-91-desc=More unusual monsters have begun to appear - similar to those that came in the wake of the strange portal. Odds are, there's another alien artefact nearby drawing them out, but no one has been able to find it yet. Someone with {color=hint}tracking{color=base} abilities might stand a better chance of chasing it down. 
miss-92-desc=After the last alien artefact incident, the guild has been tracking the stranger who came through the portal. They believe they've located another unusual item, but the unnatural monsters they normally attract haven't shown up yet - surely this means the stranger must be nearby. It might be best to have someone with good {color=hint}range {color=base}make the approach.
miss-93-desc=Apparently, several people have found artefacts left by the stranger who came through the portal. Now, someone with an artefact has surfaced and is looking to sell it off to anyone who has the gold. 
miss-94-desc=Another person has come forward trying to sell one of the alien artefacts left behind by the mysterious stranger. Word is that the item being sold is one of only two remaining artefacts that were recovered, causing a sizable bump in the selling price. 
miss-95-desc=The last alien artefact recovered from the mysterious stranger is on the market. Unsurprisingly, it's listed for the highest price yet. 
miss-96-desc=Miner's have begun excavating Occul Cavern after following underground passageways left by a giant serpent. They had just uncovered a slew of dangerous-looking weapons when they were ambushed by a gang of theives who had been following them. A strong group is needed to subdue the thieves and recover the dangerous weaponry. In order to get the jump on them, it might be best to send in someone{color=hint} sneaky{color=base}.
miss-97-desc="Hey, Arbiter who has been making such a fuss recently - you won't believe the powerful items we found in some of these underground tunnels. We heard you've also collected some powerful items - so what do you say to a 2v2 where we put them all on the line? Your strongest against us, winner take all. We'll be waiting" -Elsia and Llerval of Double Trouble. It might be best to send your {color=hint}strongest {color=base}units to show you mean business.
miss-98-desc=Liana - a marked once a favorite to become an immortal disappeared after not being selected. She has now resurfaced and it appears she has given herself over to the Maw's {color=hint}dark {color=base}power. Fueled by her new {color=hint}dark {color=base}energy, she is heading for the seat of the immortals to seize control for herself. She must be stopped!
miss-99-desc=Master a class.
